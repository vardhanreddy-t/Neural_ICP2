1) Create a class Employee and then do the following
• Create a data member to count the number of Employees
• Create a constructor to initialize name, family, salary, department
• Create a function to average salary
• Create a Fulltime Employee class and it should inherit the properties of Employee class
• Create the instances of Fulltime Employee class and Employee class and call their member functions.

ANS:We have created the generic class with name, family, salary and department -->And created a data member inorder to counting the number of employees(count_of_employees) -->And then defined the constructor with name, family, salary and department to intiliaze the variables -->And then declared the function in order to calculate the average salary of an employee -->and then defined the function inorder to show the details of an employee -->And then declared the fulltime employee class inorder to inherit the class properties bu using the super method inorder to intiliaze them. -->Then declared the main function inorder to call the functions by giving.

2)Using NumPy create random vector of size 20 having only float in the range 1-20.
Then reshape the array to 4 by 5
Then replace the max in each row by 0 (axis=1)
(you can NOT implement it via for loop)

ANS:-->In this numpy python program we have imported the numpy package inorder to get the random variables. -->used an function in order to replace the maximum value of an array based on the conditions of the axis x and y -->Then defined the main function inorder to create a random vector of size EX:To sample Unif[a, b): (b - a) * random_sample() + a -->And then reshaping the array to 4 by 5 by using the reshape(). -->Moreover, replacing the maximum value in each row by zero.
